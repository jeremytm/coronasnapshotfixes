# Corona SDK Snapshot Fixes

Drop-in fixes for 2 corona snapshot issues.

## Problems Fixed
1. Some items in the top and left halves of your snapshot are not rendered.
2. Snapshots going black after switching apps on Android.

Simply paste the code from snapshots.lua into your project anywhere before you use snapshots.

Or require the file with:
`require("snapshots")`

Enjoy.
